Qlc
===

Qlc is ported `qlc query interface` from erlang to elixir.

The qlc module implements a query interface to QLC tables. 
Typical QLC tables are ETS, Dets, and Mnesia tables. 
There is also support for user defined tables, see the Implementing 
a QLC table section. A query is stated using Query List 
Comprehensions (QLCs).
